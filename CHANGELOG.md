# Changelog

## 1.0.0 | 2016-02-09
* immutable props for `items` so that we can pure render
* a `theme` prop which allows you to add your own CSS if you don't like the defaults
* [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/) compatible CSS
* pureRender all the way down, for performance
* fully ARIA compliant
* allows a custom image element, so you can provide `srcSet` or use `<picture>` or whatever you'd like. Responsive images for the win!

### 0.5.7
Forked!
